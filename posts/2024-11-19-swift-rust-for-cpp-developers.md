I have a background in C++, and when learning new languages I tend to try and form a mental model of how those languages work from a very C or C++ developer perspective. Think: what goes on the stack, what goes on the heap, how is data passed around and shared, and so on.

Given that both Swift and Rust are meant to be replacements for C++ ("C++ successor languages") I've found documentation aimed at C++ developers very useful (and initially hard to find).

## Swift

- Doug Gregor's ["Swift for C++ Practicioners"](https://www.douggregor.net/posts/) series is excellent.

## Rust

- @nrc's ["Rust for Systems Programmers"](https://github.com/nrc/r4cppp/tree/master)
- Jack O'Connor's ["A Firehose of Rust, for busy people who know some C++"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPmRDS0OSxM&t=1222s)
  - [slower version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSyfZVuD32Y&t=0s)
  - [slides](https://jacko.io/firehose_of_rust/)
- Steve Klabnik's ["Strings in Rust"](https://steveklabnik.github.io/rust-in-ten-slides/strings.html#1) is useful.
