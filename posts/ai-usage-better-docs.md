Sometimes I come across some systems documentation that is overly abstract and obtuse.

*Yes, yes, yes it's wonderful how generic the API is, and my what wonderful protocols or traits it has*.

But sometimes I'm just trying to rapidly get a handle on an API to get a task done or to learn what it actually does.

In these cases, I've found it helpful to paste parts of the documentation into ChatGPT and ask it to:
- rewrite the documentation text in simpler, more concrete terms
- add some simple example code

This approach gave me a much clearer and more useful result than the original documentation.

I really like using LLMs this way â€” it helps deepen understanding, not just generate code.
