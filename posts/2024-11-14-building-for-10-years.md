Redditor IAmRules [shares his wisdom from "Building now for 10 years"](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1gji2eo/my_lessons_from_building_fast/lvdi7q9/)

Some highlights:

>Build value, it doesn’t need to be large value, but clear value.



>You don’t get a second chance at a first impression. Building incomplete products will make your work seem untrustworthy and sloppy. Reduce scope if you must, but whatever you ship make it spotless.

>You don’t spent 6 months building and give up after a week with no sales. Marketing is not a thing you do after building either, but it takes a while for you to find a market and cater your project to fit it. There is a point where you need to pivot, but it’s not “ship it, no sales, move on”. Nobody care that you shipped. It’s your job to find people, not the other way around.

> ...be in a hurry to provide value..
