[Async Rust Isn't Bad: You Are](https://n8s.site/async-rust-isnt-bad-you-are)
  - As the Swift ecosystem struggles with Swift 6's concurrency additions, it's interesting to see some discussion of concurrency support in Rust-land.

[Writing Javascript without a build system](https://jvns.ca/blog/2023/02/16/writing-javascript-without-a-build-system/)
  - It's both nice to see other people don't want the overkill of a build system in small projects and also disappointing how much work it is to do this.

[Marble Madness style game in WebGL - netlify promotion](https://5-million-devs.netlify.com)
  - [HN Discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42212644)

  - [Comment by one of the developers about the tech used](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42214317)
  - I really enjoyed seeing this. Another showcase of what you can do with 3d graphics in the web browser. Makes me want to go back and play around with three.js again...

[AWS Lambda turns 10: A rare look at the doc that started it](https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/2024/11/aws-lambda-turns-10-a-rare-look-at-the-doc-that-started-it.html)

- I have heard about various working practices at AWS, so it's interesting to see a concrete example of some of the process.

[Why Not Bluesky - Tim Bray](https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2024/11/15/Not-Bluesky)
  - [Bluesky and enshittification (02 Nov 2024) â€“ Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/2024/11/02/ulysses-pact/#tie-yourself-to-a-federated-mast)
  - Bluesky is blowing up in usage, so I finally read some intelligent commentary about why some people are not going to support it. Well worth reading.
