# What is this?

New Github pages website for Krishna.github.io.

I wanted to make Github Pages my main blog presence, because I have a great username there.

Decided to use [Lume](http://lume.land/) deno static site generator to do this.
It should be simple right?

Set up the blog with:

  deno run -A https://lume.land/init.ts --theme=simple-blog
