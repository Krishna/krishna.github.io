Just a page to make sure code highlighting is working.

### Javascript:

```Javascript
const hello = "Hello world";
function greeting(name) {
  console.log("Hello " + name);
}
```

### Swift:

And here we are with some Swift code.

```swift
var myString = "Hello World"
```

### GoLang:

```go
var x := CallSomeFunction();
```

### Rust:

```rust
fn greet(): String {
    // do something
}
```

### Typescript:

```typescript
let s: String = Hello;
```

### Python:

```python
def hello:
    print("hello")
```



And this is the end.
