                    <p><strong>What:</strong> Toilet leaked when flushed.</p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Learned:</strong> Problem was with the seal on
                        the pipe from the cistern (flush panel) to the bowl.
                        Took plumber less than an hour to fix. Hardest bit was
                        getting the cabinet off the toilet, and then checking
                        everything (leak finding).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Felt Good:</strong> Getting this done. Another
                        home problem solved.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Felt Bad:</strong> Took me ages to get a plumber
                        and resolve this. Fear of getting a bad plumber, not
                        knowing who was good, getting ripped off, work being
                        more expensive etc. <strong>FEAR</strong>.
