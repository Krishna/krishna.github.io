I love looking at artists (and other creators) sketchbooks.

Love seeing the process behind the work, the half-finished ideas, the unexplored concepts. Sometimes I enjoy these things more than the finished, polished final artefact.

Needless to say I have many such sketchbooks - full of ideas, code, designs, writing, apps. 

A lack of ideas is not a problem I usually contend with.

But... sharing and publishing those things, has always been a problem for me. The idea of building in public, or sharing unfinished work is... frightening to me. Not quaking in my boots, flight-or-fight fear, but fear nonetheless - I experience deep resistance to doing this even when I want to. There's always a small improvement I intend to make before publishing or sharing my unfinished work.

This is of course the tyranny of perfectionism. A manifestation of the fear of not being good enough. It's easy to hide behind not wanting to "ship crap" and the fear of my unfinished, unpolished work being used to judge me. But ultimately it's a limiting belief.

So I'm actively going to be pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I'll be publishing more from my "sketchbooks". I'll tag such posts clearly, and hopefully I'll get more comfortable sharing more.

*Confession: I took too long to write and finally publish this. But it's a start.*
