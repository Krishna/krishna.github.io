excerpt: Deliver value in the simplest way
---
When building something there are many choices to make. Technical decisions on how to implement features of the product.

You may feel you must build every aspect of your product in the most complete and sophisticated way.

This is a trap.

Resist this urge for all but the most critical aspects of your product.

Instead ask yourself: How can I deliver the value of this feature in the easiest way?

This might mean doing something that feels incomplete or imperfect. It might mean deferring the feature. Or it might mean rethinking how to deliver the value of that feature in a completely different way.

If the feature isn't something that is going to differentiate your product, do the easy thing.

Take the easy path and get closer towards shipping.
